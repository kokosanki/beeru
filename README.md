# beeru - https://beeru.netlify.com/

## Summary: 
This is my first React application. It uses API provided by https://punkapi.com/ and displays various beers. The main feature of the application is the 'favorite' button, which adds a chosen beer to the 'favorites' subpage. The navigation is managed by React Router. The application uses Firebase Firestore, which stores chosen beers.

## Technologies:
